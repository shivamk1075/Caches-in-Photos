# Object Detection with YOLO and ONNX Runtime

This notebook performs object detection on images using a YOLO ONNX model and OpenCV. Run all cells to install dependencies, load the model, and visualize detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

See code.ipynb for notebook code and details.
